1. How Arguments Are Handled by the Script
 Step 1: Looks for --help, which displays directions.
 Reads the flags (-n, -v, -vn) in step two:
 Line numbers are displayed.
 -v → Displays mismatched lines.
 Step 3: Uses the filename and search term.
 Step 4: Looks for mistakes (missing word or file).
=========================================================
 2. Adding More Features (Like Regex or -i/-c/-l)
To add:
 Regex: Change == to =~ in matching.
 -i (case-sensitive): Remove ,, lowercase conversion.
 -c (count matches): Add a counter, print total at the end.
 -l (show filenames only): Print filename instead of lines.
============================================================
 3. Hardest Part to Implement
Inverting the match (-v flag):
Because Bash doesn’t have simple "true/false" flipping.
